EdgeGallery Introduction
------------------------
Edgegallery is a 5g MEC open source edge computing platform. It is an end-to-end solution for application and application developers. For app applications, in addition to the basic MEP platform supporting application running, it also provides an app management system (MEC Manager, minimal management, including some functions of MEPM and MEAO), can manage the end-to-end life cycle of applications, provide a toolchain for the migration of X86 applications to arm, and support the smooth cross-platform migration and tuning of applications. For application developers, it provides a complete ide environment and integrated verification environment for application development and provides a one-stop development experience for application developers. At the same time, the app store function provides a standard access verification process for apps developed by application developers.
