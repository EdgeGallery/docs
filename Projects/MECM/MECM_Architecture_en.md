### API Handler

* Provides northbound interfaces for application LCM operations.     

### BPMN Execution Engine

* The BPMN execution engine executes application lifecycle management related process flows.

### API Handler
 Provides northbound interfaces for application LCM operations.

### K8s Plugin adapter
 K8s plugin adapter communicates with K8s plugin to perform LCM operation on K8s environment.

### K8s Plugin
 K8s plugin is responsible for interaction with kubernetes infra for LCM operations.


## Deployment view
