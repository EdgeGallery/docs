Error fix for Header #,##,### and links with [], and ()
    a) In local setup, add myst_parser in extensions of conf.py file.
    b) myst_parser version is 0.14.0 for proper working.
    c) Run make gettext in docs folder of the project to create fresh .pot files.
    d) Now, use "sphinx-intl update -p build/gettext -l en --line-width=99999999999999999999999" to update .po files
    e) Translate/Auto-translate the po files and push in the po code.

Images link
   a) During auto-translation images links have extra spaces, and the link should be written properly.
   b) Same as header issue, with myst_parser in conf.py this issue is resolved.

Bullet numbering and rst headers
   a) Appstore.rst picks headers from the tree beneath like Appstore_Overview.po and Appstore_Interfaces.po. Making sure these files are properly written with English changes in required for rst file English reflection. For this step 1 should be followed.

Internal hrefs:
   a) Internal hrefs has space between [] and (). This should be removed.
   b) The links inside () should not have any space. Else the changes won't be reflected.
